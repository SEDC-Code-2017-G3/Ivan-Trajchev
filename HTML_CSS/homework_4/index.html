                    Over the past few years, Athenian hardware brand Dreadbox has been steadily picking up fans with its line of effects, synths
                    and modules. Now it is unleashing a new flagship synth, Abyss.

            <p>
                The Abyss is a four-voice analogue polysynth, loosely based around the sound engine of Dreadbox’s now-discontinued Murmux
                range. It comes in the form of a desktop module, built into a fixed-angled aluminium chassis a little over
                a foot in length. There’s a simplicity to the unit’s build that’s revealing of Dreadbox’s small, independent
                operation, but what the synth lacks in design flourishes it makes up for in sheer

                <strong>
                    From the blurb The return of a legend or the beginning of a new era? The Prophet '08 is an eight-voice synthesizer with a
                    100% analog signal path. While the Prophet '08's overall sonic character will be familiar to anyone who
                    knows Dave's work from the '70s and '80s, it is much more than just a vintage reissue with a few new
                    bells and whistles.

                Of course, it includes features we now take for granted, like velocity and aftertouch. Add to that performance features like
                an arpeggiator, gated step sequencer, and the ability to split and layer sounds. The modulation possibilities
                are much deeper than anything Sequential ever produced, making it capable of producing sounds the "classics"
                simply could not. Dave has always said that he is only interested in moving forward. The Prophet '08 is the
                product of evolution

                <hr> Music Radar: How to set up your monitors in your studio

                <strong>
                    Armed with a decent set of monitor speakers, the next stage is to set them up to deliver the best possible performance in
                    your studio space. Doing this inevitably requires the application of a bit of science and some trial
                    and error, but it’s one of the most important aspects of tuning your setup to get the absolute best listening
                    experience.

            </p>
            <p>
                There are three key aspects to consider: how you position the monitors in relation to the listener; how you mount the monitors
                on a desk or stands; and how you position that whole configuration within your studio space. Let’s look at
                each of these in turn.
